# King County Housing project
# Introduction
## Introduction: We have home owners who are looking to make improvements to their house and are wondering what they should do for an improvement to maximise the overall sale price of the House.
# Data Cleaning and Filtering
## Data was filtered using both statistical methods such as recursve data elimintation, correlation charts and heatmaps.  Also filtered using inferential methods such as determining what were things that the homeowner could actually change.
# Conclusion
## In conclusion, adding a bedroom, bathroom or square footage to the living area will not deliver the greatest return is sale price, increasing the condition of the homw will give greatest increase in sale value.  With a 13% increase for average condition, 21% increase in value for Good and a 35% increase for very good.  We were able to have a descriptive quality of describing 53.2% of possible errors in the equation and we eliminated any variables from consideration with a p- value greater than .05.

## We ruled out certain variables in this analysis due to the fact that they would be unchangable by the home owner who was attempting to sell the home, but in the future if we were to revist this data for a house flipper or a real estat agency, we would investigate sqft_living15 and the location of the home as this would give us a starting point as to where we could look to purchase a home and remodel for the greatest increased sale price.
